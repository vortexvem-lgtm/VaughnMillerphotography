<h1> About me</h1>
<br>

<p class="indent">
   Hi! My name is Vaughn, and I’m a photographer based in the Milwaukee area.
    I grew up with those little Tikes cameras where you could barely make out 
    what the picture was. Back then, it wasn’t about sharpness or perfection —
     it was about curiosity and the instinct to capture something that felt
important.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Now, I work with a camera capable of capturing moments that were never able to
 be seen before. You can feel the motion from the notion — the idea turning
  into movement — and the raw, down-low energy that lives inside each frame.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    I focus on moody city scenes, quiet moments, and low-light storytelling.
     This space is a collection of moments that didn’t need to be loud.
      Whether it’s the intensity of motion or the stillness between it,
       my goal is to create images that feel lived in — moments you don’t just
    see, but feel.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    Through light, shadow, and movement, my photography explores emotion,
    energy, and the subtle details that often go unnoticed.
